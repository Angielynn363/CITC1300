                <h3>Humane Educational Society</h3>
                <p>MISSION & HISTORY.
                Provide a safe haven for homeless, abused and neglected animals in our community and advocate on their behalf.
                <p></p>
                Humane Educational Society was incorporated in 1910 by Ethel Hardy who was known for picking up stray cats and dogs while driving her carriage through the streets of Chattanooga.  Since then, we have grown to serve Hamilton County and take in four to five thousand homeless pets each year.  We are an open-door facility to residents of our service area that provides adoption services, animal protection, cruelty investigation, pet licenses, and essential care for homeless pets.  Humane Educational Society is committed to finding each and every treatable, adoptable, trainable animal in our facility a loving home to make Hamilton County a better place for pets.</p>

                <h3>A Paw and a Prayer</h3>
                <p>A Paw and A Prayer Rescue is the result of friends with a common bond - to help dogs that were abandoned, neglected and abused in the Chattanooga and surrounding areas. We are volunteers who work other jobs and in our "spare" time we bring dogs into our home setting and begin the adoption process. We are not funded by any organization and operate from our own resources and donations. We rely entirely on the generosity of friends and strangers. Some dogs come to us by owners who no longer want them or who can no longer care for them. Often owners surrender their pets to local shelters and there is a chance that their beloved pet could be euthanized.
                <p></p>
                This is where APAAP comes into the picture - we try to help reduce the number of pets turned into shelters. We also try to help our local shelters by pulling abandoned adoptable pets into our foster program. As APAAP has grown we have initiated a Foster Parent Program. Without our foster parents we could not pull and rescue as many dogs as we do. If you are interested in helping us find out what you can do. Once they have been rescued they are vaccinated, treated for intestinal parasites, and are spayed or neutered. Many of our dogs require additional expensive medical treatment, for heartworms, broken bones, mange and other diseases.?</p>
