            <h2>The Retina</h2>
            <p>The retina is made up of layers of light sensitive nerve tissue that process the light that enters the eye and send it to the brain through the optic nerve.</p>

            <h3>Macula</h3>
            <p>The macula is the area where focused light meets the retina. It is responsible for our clearest centeral vision.</p>

            <h3>Retinal Disorders</h3>
            <p> There are several retinal disorders that can cause significant vision loss or blindess. Some common ones are retinal detachements or tears where the retinal nerve layers are pulled from the surface of the eye, diabetic retinopathy which is bleeding between the layers of the retina usually caused by poor blood sugar control, and macular degeneration which is typically an age related disorder. Macular degeneration can be genetic but is more likely to occur in smokers, people with poor heart health and diet, and excessive unprotected exposure to ultraviolet light.</p>
